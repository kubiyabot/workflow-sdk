Connect external AI tools, services, and data sources to your Composer workflows through MCP (Model Context Protocol).

## What is MCP?

MCP lets you extend Composer with:
- **External AI services** like Claude, ChatGPT, or custom models
- **Third-party tools** that aren't built into Composer
- **Internal services** and APIs from your organization
- **Data sources** like databases, file systems, or knowledge bases

## Quick setup

1. **Go to Settings** → **Integrations** → **MCP Servers**
2. **Add a new server** with the connection details
3. **Test the connection** to make sure it works
4. **Grant permissions** for what the server can access
5. **Use in workflows** - agents can now call these tools

## Common MCP integrations

**AI models:**
- Connect custom LLMs or specialized AI services
- Use domain-specific models (legal, medical, financial)
- Integrate proprietary AI tools your company has built

**Data sources:**
- Connect internal databases and knowledge bases
- Access file systems, document repositories
- Integrate with CRM, ERP, or other business systems

**Development tools:**
- Custom CI/CD systems not in the built-in catalog  
- Internal code analysis or security scanning tools
- Proprietary deployment or monitoring systems

## Using MCP in workflows

Once connected, MCP tools work like any other tool:

**In chat:** *"Use our custom security scanner to check the main branch"*

**In workflows:** Add MCP tools as workflow steps alongside built-in tools.

**For agents:** Agents automatically know about MCP tools and can use them.

## Security and permissions

**Network isolation:** MCP servers run in isolated environments.

**Permission scoping:** Control what each MCP server can access.

**Audit logging:** All MCP tool usage is logged and trackable.

**Credential management:** API keys and secrets are stored securely.

## Troubleshooting

**Connection issues:** Check network access and firewall settings.

**Authentication failures:** Verify API keys and credentials are current.

**Performance problems:** Monitor resource usage and optimize queries.

**Tool not appearing:** Check server registration and permission settings.

## Advanced configuration

**Custom protocols:** Extend MCP with your own communication protocols.

**Load balancing:** Distribute requests across multiple server instances.

**Caching:** Improve performance with response caching.

**Monitoring:** Set up alerts for server health and performance.
