Source Management lets you connect and sync Git repositories and tool sources that power your workflows and integrations.

## What are Sources?

Sources are the foundation of your tools and workflows:

- **Git Repositories** - Your application code, infrastructure as code, scripts
- **Tool Collections** - Curated sets of tools for specific use cases  
- **Custom Tools** - Your organization's proprietary automation tools
- **Configuration Files** - Environment-specific settings and parameters

## Connecting Git Repositories

1. **Navigate to Resources** â†’ **Sources**
2. **Click "Add Source"** 
3. **Select "Git Repository"**
4. **Enter repository details:**
   - Repository URL (public or private)
   - Branch to track (default: main)
   - Authentication credentials if needed
5. **Choose runner environment**
6. **Test and save**

When adding a new Git source, specify the source name, repository URL, branch, and target runner for execution.

## Source Types

**Public Repositories:**
- No authentication required
- Great for open-source tools and documentation
- Automatically sync on changes

**Private Repositories:**  
- Requires authentication (SSH keys, tokens, etc.)
- Secure access to proprietary code
- Full version control integration

**Tool Packages:**
- Pre-built tool collections from the marketplace
- Community-contributed automation tools
- Enterprise tool bundles

## Managing Sources

**Sync Status:**
Monitor synchronization with your repositories and get notified of any issues.

**Version Control:**
Track which commit/branch is currently deployed and roll back if needed.

**Access Control:**
Set permissions for who can modify source configurations and deploy changes.

**Health Monitoring:**
Get alerts when sources become unavailable or sync fails.

Individual tools from sources show detailed configuration including secrets, environment variables, Docker image, and tool content with helper functions.

## Using Sources in Workflows

Once connected, source tools become available to agents:

**Tool Discovery:** Agents automatically discover tools from your connected sources.

**Version Management:** Tools update automatically when you push changes to the source repository.

**Environment Isolation:** Different runners can use different versions of the same tools.

**Dependency Management:** Tools can declare dependencies on other tools or services.

## Best Practices

**Repository Structure:**
- Keep tools in a dedicated `/tools` directory
- Include clear documentation for each tool
- Use semantic versioning for releases

**Security:**
- Use least-privilege access for repository connections
- Regularly rotate authentication tokens
- Scan code for security vulnerabilities

**Performance:**
- Keep tool repositories lightweight
- Use efficient Docker base images
- Implement proper caching strategies

## Troubleshooting

**Sync Issues:**
- Check network connectivity to Git provider
- Verify authentication credentials are valid
- Review repository permissions

**Tool Not Available:**
- Ensure tool meets format requirements
- Check for syntax errors in tool definitions
- Verify runner compatibility

**Performance Problems:**
- Monitor repository size and cleanup old files
- Optimize Docker images for faster loading
- Consider using tool caching

**Getting started?** Connect a simple public repository first to understand how sources work, then add your private repositories.
