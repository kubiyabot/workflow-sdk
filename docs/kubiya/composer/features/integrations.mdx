# Integrations & Tools Management

The Integrations section of Composer is your centralized hub for connecting external services, managing authentication, and discovering new tools to enhance your AI automation capabilities.

## Integrations Overview

### What Are Integrations?
Integrations are pre-built connections to external services and tools that your AI agents can use to perform tasks. They handle authentication, API communication, and provide a standardized interface for various services.

  authentication: {
    type: "oauth2",
    authUrl: "https://service.com/oauth/authorize",
    tokenUrl: "https://service.com/oauth/token",
    scopes: ["read", "write"]
  },
  endpoints: [
    {
      name: "listUsers",
      method: "GET",
      url: "/api/users",
      responseType: "json"
    }
  ],
  tools: [
    {
      name: "create_user",
      description: "Create a new user account",
      parameters: {
        username: { type: "string", required: true },
        email: { type: "string", required: true }
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

## Integration Security

### Authentication Management
All integration credentials are:
- **Encrypted at Rest**: Using enterprise-grade encryption
- **Encrypted in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Regularly Rotated**: Automatic token refresh where supported
- **Audited**: Full audit trail of credential usage

### Permission Management
Control integration access with:

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```yaml
Admin Role:
  - Create/delete integrations
  - Modify all settings
  - View all usage statistics
  - Manage team permissions

User Role:
  - Use existing integrations
  - View personal usage stats
  - Create tasks using available tools
  - Limited configuration access

Viewer Role:
  - View available integrations
  - Read-only access to configurations
  - No execution permissions
```

#### Integration-Level Permissions
- **Read-Only**: Query data but cannot make changes
- **Read-Write**: Full operational access
- **Admin**: Integration management capabilities
- **Custom**: Granular permission sets

### Security Best Practices

## Integration Monitoring

### Health Monitoring Dashboard
Monitor all integration health from a centralized dashboard:

#### Real-Time Status Indicators
- **ðŸŸ¢ Operational**: All systems functional
- **ðŸŸ¡ Degraded**: Some functionality affected
- **ðŸ”´ Outage**: Service unavailable
- **ðŸ”„ Maintenance**: Planned maintenance window

#### Performance Metrics
```yaml
Key Metrics:
  Response Time: Average API response latency
  Success Rate: Percentage of successful requests
  Error Rate: Failed requests per hour
  Throughput: Requests processed per minute
  Uptime: Service availability percentage
```

### Usage Analytics
Track integration usage patterns:

#### Usage Statistics
- **API Calls**: Total requests by integration
- **Data Transfer**: Bandwidth consumption
- **Active Users**: Who is using each integration
- **Popular Tools**: Most frequently used capabilities
- **Error Patterns**: Common failure scenarios

#### Cost Tracking
For integrations with usage-based billing:
- **API Call Costs**: Track billable requests
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor consumption limits
- **Budget Alerts**: Notifications for cost thresholds
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Reduce unnecessary usage

## Troubleshooting Integrations

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Authentication Failures
```yaml
OAuth Token Expired:
  Solution: Refresh tokens automatically or manually reconnect
  Prevention: Enable automatic token refresh

API Key Invalid:
  Solution: Verify key in source system and update in Composer
  Prevention: Set up key rotation reminders

Permission Denied:
  Solution: Review and expand granted permissions
  Prevention: Request appropriate scopes during setup
```

#### Connection Problems
```yaml
Network Timeout:
  Solution: Check firewall rules and network connectivity
  Prevention: Implement retry logic and health checks

Rate Limiting:
  Solution: Implement exponential backoff and request queuing
  Prevention: Monitor usage patterns and optimize requests

Service Unavailable:
  Solution: Check service status and implement fallback options
  Prevention: Set up monitoring and alerting
```

### Diagnostic Tools

#### Connection Tester
Built-in tools for troubleshooting:
- **Connectivity Check**: Verify network reachability
- **Authentication Test**: Validate credentials
- **Permission Audit**: Check granted vs. required permissions
- **Latency Test**: Measure response times

#### Integration Logs
Detailed logging for debugging:
- **Request/Response Logs**: Full API communication details
- **Error Logs**: Detailed error messages and stack traces
- **Performance Logs**: Timing and resource usage data
- **Audit Logs**: User actions and configuration changes
