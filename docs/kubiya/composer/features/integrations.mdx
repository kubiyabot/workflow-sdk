Connect all your infrastructure tools in one place so AI agents can work across your entire stack.

![Integrations Overview](/assets/screenshots/composer/integrations/integrations-overview.png)

The integrations catalog provides easy access to configure connections with popular services like AWS, GitHub, Jira, Slack, and Kubernetes.

![Integrations Catalog](/assets/screenshots/composer/integrations/integrations-catalog.png)

Browse through different integration categories to find the services you need to connect.

## Popular integrations

**Cloud platforms:**
- AWS, Azure, Google Cloud - manage resources, deployments, monitoring
- Terraform - infrastructure as code automation
- Kubernetes - container orchestration and management

**Development:**
- GitHub, GitLab - code management, PR automation, CI/CD
- Docker - container building and registry management
- Jenkins - build automation and deployment pipelines

**Communication:**
- Slack, Microsoft Teams - notifications, ChatOps commands
- Email - automated alerts and reports
- PagerDuty - incident management and escalation

**Monitoring:**
- Prometheus, Grafana - metrics collection and visualization
- Datadog, New Relic - APM and infrastructure monitoring
- Splunk - log analysis and search

## How to connect

1. **Click "Resources"** in the left sidebar
2. **Select "New Stack"** to browse integrations
3. **Choose your service** from the catalog
4. **Authenticate** - usually OAuth or API key
5. **Test the connection** to ensure it works
6. **Start using** - agents can now access this tool

Custom integrations allow you to connect tools and services with secret-based authentication beyond the standard catalog.

![Datadog Integration Setup](/assets/screenshots/composer/integrations/datadog-integration-setup.png)

When setting up integrations like Datadog, you'll need to provide configuration details such as API keys, application keys, and environment settings.

## Managing integrations

**View status:** See which integrations are healthy, need attention, or are offline.

**Update credentials:** Rotate API keys and refresh OAuth tokens easily.

**Set permissions:** Control what each integration can access in your systems.

**Monitor usage:** Track how often each integration is used by agents and workflows.

## Integration security

**Least privilege:** Each integration only gets the minimum permissions needed.

**Credential encryption:** All API keys and secrets are encrypted at rest.

**Audit logs:** Every integration usage is logged with full details.

**Network isolation:** Integrations run in secure, isolated environments.

## Troubleshooting

**Connection failing?** 
- Check if API keys are still valid
- Verify network connectivity
- Ensure service isn't under maintenance

**Missing permissions?**
- Review OAuth scopes granted
- Check if user has admin access
- Verify service-specific permission settings

**Poor performance?**
- Check API rate limits
- Monitor network latency
- Consider caching frequently accessed data

**Start simple:** Connect one tool you use every day, like GitHub or AWS. Once you see how it works, add more integrations.
