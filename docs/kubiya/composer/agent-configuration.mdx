Agent Configuration allows you to customize AI engines, select models, choose execution environments, and create specialized agents for your automation needs.

![Agent Playground Overview](/assets/images/agent_playground_overview.png)

## Agent Types

**On Demand (Execute):** Create custom agents with specific engines, tools, and configuration for immediate execution.

**Existing Agent from Organization:** Use pre-configured agents from your organization's catalog with inherited settings.

**Import Agent Preset:** Load agent configurations from URLs, paste JSON/YAML directly, or generate new agents with AI assistance.

## AI Engine & Model Configuration

### Selecting AI Engines

**Claude Code (Recommended):** Anthropic Claude models with enhanced tooling capabilities
**LiteLLM:** Universal LLM gateway supporting multiple providers
**Claude Code:** Direct access to Claude models with advanced reasoning

### Available Models

![Model Selection Dropdown](/assets/screenshots/composer/agent-configuration/model-selection-dropdown.png)

**Claude Sonnet 4:** Latest Claude model with enhanced reasoning and performance
**Claude Opus 4:** Most capable Claude model for complex analysis and problem-solving  
**GPT-4o:** OpenAI's most advanced multimodal model

### Execution Runners

Choose from available execution environments:
- **kubiya-prod:** Production environment
- **kubiya-hosted:** Managed cloud runner (recommended)
- **core-testing-1, core-testing-2:** Testing environments
- **costa-least-privileges:** Security-focused environment
- **enforcer:** Compliance-focused runner
- **gcp-no-vcluster:** Google Cloud environment
- **omer-runner, pai-runner:** Specialized runners
- **pargevestaging:** Staging environment

## Importing Agent Presets

### From URL

![Import Agent from URL](/assets/screenshots/composer/agent-configuration/import-agent-url.png)

Load agent configurations directly from GitHub, GitLab, or any public repository. Supports JSON, YAML, and YML formats.

### Paste Configuration

![Import Agent Paste Config](/assets/screenshots/composer/agent-configuration/import-agent-paste-config.png)

Paste JSON or YAML agent configurations directly into the interface for quick setup.

### Generate with AI

![Generate with AI Description](/assets/screenshots/composer/agent-configuration/generate-with-ai-description.png)

Describe your desired agent functionality and let AI generate a complete configuration.

**Example prompts:**
- "agent that can interact with kubernetes clusters"
- "I need an agent that can talk with AWS and create instances via EC2 running on hosted runner"

![AI Agent Generation Process](/assets/screenshots/composer/agent-configuration/ai-agent-generation-process.png)

The AI assistant analyzes your requirements and generates a comprehensive agent configuration with:
- Relevant tool searches
- Agent detail extraction
- Customized capabilities

## Generated Agent Configuration

![Generated Kubernetes Agent](/assets/screenshots/composer/agent-configuration/generated-kubernetes-agent.png)

Generated agents include:
- **Agent Name:** Descriptive name (e.g., "Kubernetes Operations Manager")
- **Description:** Comprehensive capabilities overview
- **AI Instructions:** Detailed operational guidelines
- **Tools:** Pre-configured tool set (kubectl-cluster-info, etc.)
- **Environment Variables:** Required configuration (KUBECONFIG, KUBECTL_VERSION)

![Agent Configuration Details](/assets/screenshots/composer/agent-configuration/agent-configuration-details.png)

Review the complete agent specification including:
- Core capabilities and operational guidelines
- Tool configurations and Docker images
- Environment variables and secrets
- JSON specification for export

## Agent Preview & Import

![Agent Preview and Import](/assets/screenshots/composer/agent-configuration/agent-preview-and-import.png)

Before importing, review the agent configuration showing:
- **Tools:** Number of included tools (3)
- **Secrets:** Required secrets count (0)
- **Integrations:** Connected services (0)
- **Environment Variables:** Configuration variables (2)

**Actions available:**
- **Accept & Use Agent:** Import and make available
- **Reject:** Cancel the import
- **Continue Chatting:** Modify the configuration

## Using Configured Agents

Once configured, your custom agents appear in the task creation interface alongside the AI engine and execution environment, ready for workflow automation.

## Configuration Best Practices

**Model Selection:**
- Use Claude Sonnet 4 for most general-purpose tasks
- Choose Claude Opus 4 for complex reasoning and analysis
- Select GPT-4o for multimodal tasks requiring vision capabilities

**Runner Selection:**
- Use `kubiya-hosted` for production workloads (managed and recommended)
- Choose specialized runners for specific security or compliance requirements
- Test configurations in staging environments before production deployment

**Agent Design:**
- Create focused agents with specific domain expertise
- Include comprehensive AI instructions for consistent behavior
- Configure only necessary tools to maintain security boundaries
- Use descriptive names and documentation for team collaboration

**Security Considerations:**
- Review generated configurations before importing
- Validate tool permissions and access scopes
- Use least-privilege execution environments
- Regularly audit agent capabilities and usage
