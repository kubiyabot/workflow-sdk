Activity Monitoring provides comprehensive visibility into your system's performance, user activity, and workflow execution across your Kubiya environment.

![Activity Dashboard Overview](/assets/screenshots/composer/activity/activity-dashboard-overview.png)

## Activity Overview

The main dashboard shows key metrics across your organization:

**Total Events:** Track all system activities and interactions over time
**Active Users:** Monitor unique users actively using the platform  
**Messages Processed:** Count of agent interactions and workflow communications
**Average Response Time:** Performance metric for system responsiveness

## System Health Monitoring

**Success Rate:** Percentage of successful operations and workflows
**Response Time:** System performance and latency metrics
**System Load:** Resource utilization and capacity planning

Monitor these indicators to ensure optimal system performance and identify potential issues before they impact users.

## Activity Categories

**Overview Dashboard:**
- High-level metrics and key performance indicators
- System health status and alerts
- Resource utilization summaries
