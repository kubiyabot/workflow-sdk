Workflow Automation in Composer enables you to create sophisticated, repeatable automation sequences that leverage AI agents and your connected tools.

## Automation Fundamentals

**Task-to-Workflow Pipeline:** Transform successful ad-hoc tasks into reusable workflows that your team can execute consistently.

**Agent-Driven Execution:** Workflows use AI agents to make intelligent decisions, handle errors, and adapt to different environments.

**Infrastructure-Aware:** Workflows understand your infrastructure context and can safely operate across different environments.

## Creating Automated Workflows

### From Successful Tasks

1. **Execute a task** successfully through the chat interface
2. **Review the execution flow** and identify reusable patterns  
3. **Click "Save as Workflow"** to convert the task sequence
4. **Configure parameters** that should be variables
5. **Test the workflow** in a safe environment

### Visual Workflow Builder

**Drag-and-Drop Components:**
- **Triggers:** GitHub webhooks, scheduled execution, manual triggers
- **Conditions:** Environment checks, resource validation, approval gates
- **Actions:** Tool executions, agent interactions, data transformations
- **Notifications:** Slack messages, email alerts, dashboard updates

### Agent Integration Patterns

**Sequential Agent Execution:**
```yaml
steps:
  - agent: "aws-specialist"
    task: "Provision EC2 instances"
    outputs: ["instance_ids", "security_groups"]
  
  - agent: "kubernetes-operator"  
    task: "Deploy application to cluster"
    inputs: ["instance_ids"]
    
  - agent: "monitoring-agent"
    task: "Configure alerts and dashboards"
    inputs: ["instance_ids", "app_endpoints"]
```

**Parallel Agent Processing:**
```yaml
parallel:
  - agent: "security-scanner"
    task: "Run vulnerability assessment"
    
  - agent: "performance-tester"
    task: "Execute load tests"
    
  - agent: "compliance-checker"
    task: "Validate policy compliance"
```

## Common Automation Patterns

### CI/CD Automation

**GitHub to Production Pipeline:**
1. **Trigger:** GitHub webhook on main branch push
2. **Agent:** Code analysis and security scan
3. **Condition:** All checks pass
4. **Agent:** Build and containerize application  
5. **Agent:** Deploy to staging environment
6. **Agent:** Run integration tests
7. **Condition:** Tests successful
8. **Agent:** Deploy to production
9. **Notification:** Team success/failure alert

### Infrastructure Management

**Auto-Scaling Response:**
1. **Trigger:** CloudWatch metric threshold
2. **Agent:** Analyze current resource utilization
3. **Condition:** Scale-up criteria met
4. **Agent:** Provision additional resources
5. **Agent:** Update load balancer configuration
6. **Agent:** Verify healthy deployment
7. **Notification:** Operations team update

### Incident Response

**Automated Remediation:**
1. **Trigger:** Alert from monitoring system
2. **Agent:** Diagnose issue severity and scope
3. **Condition:** Auto-remediation approved for issue type
4. **Agent:** Execute standard remediation steps
5. **Agent:** Verify resolution effectiveness
6. **Condition:** Issue resolved or escalate
7. **Notification:** Incident status update

## Agent Consumption Strategies

### Specialized Agent Roles

**Domain Expertise:** Create agents with specific knowledge domains:
- **AWS-Expert:** Deep knowledge of AWS services and best practices
- **K8s-Operator:** Kubernetes cluster management and troubleshooting  
- **Security-Guardian:** Security scanning, compliance, and remediation
- **Data-Engineer:** ETL processes, database management, analytics

**Tool-Specific Agents:** Optimize agents for specific tool interactions:
- **Git-Manager:** Repository operations, branch management, code review
- **Docker-Builder:** Container creation, registry management, optimization
- **Terraform-Operator:** Infrastructure as code deployment and management

### Agent Orchestration Patterns

**Handoff Pattern:**
```yaml
workflow:
  - name: "requirements_analysis"
    agent: "business-analyst"
    output: "requirements_spec"
    
  - name: "architecture_design"  
    agent: "solutions-architect"
    input: "requirements_spec"
    output: "architecture_plan"
    
  - name: "implementation"
    agent: "dev-team-lead"
    input: "architecture_plan"
```

**Consensus Pattern:**
```yaml
workflow:
  - name: "multi_agent_review"
    parallel:
      - agent: "security-expert"
        task: "Security assessment"
      - agent: "performance-expert"  
        task: "Performance evaluation"
      - agent: "cost-optimizer"
        task: "Cost analysis"
        
  - name: "consensus_decision"
    agent: "decision-maker"
    inputs: ["security_report", "performance_report", "cost_analysis"]
    task: "Make final deployment decision"
```

**Retry and Recovery Pattern:**
```yaml
workflow:
  - name: "primary_deployment"
    agent: "deployment-agent"
    retry_policy:
      max_attempts: 3
      backoff: "exponential"
      
  - name: "rollback_on_failure"
    condition: "primary_deployment.failed"
    agent: "rollback-agent"
    task: "Restore previous version"
```

## Advanced Automation Features

### Dynamic Agent Selection

**Context-Aware Agent Choice:**
```yaml
steps:
  - name: "select_deployment_agent"
    condition: |
      if environment == "production":
        return "production-deployment-agent"
      elif environment == "staging":
        return "staging-deployment-agent"  
      else:
        return "development-deployment-agent"
```

### Approval Workflows

**Human-in-the-Loop Integration:**
```yaml
steps:
  - name: "prepare_production_deployment"
    agent: "deployment-planner"
    
  - name: "request_approval"
    type: "approval_gate"
    approvers: ["ops-manager", "security-lead"]
    timeout: "24h"
    
  - name: "execute_deployment"
    condition: "request_approval.approved"
    agent: "production-deployer"
```

### Error Handling and Monitoring

**Comprehensive Error Management:**
```yaml
workflow:
  error_handling:
    - type: "network_timeout"
      action: "retry_with_backoff"
      max_attempts: 3
      
    - type: "permission_denied"
      action: "escalate_to_admin"
      
    - type: "resource_limit"
      action: "provision_additional_resources"
      
  monitoring:
    - metric: "execution_time"
      threshold: "30min"
      alert: "performance-team"
      
    - metric: "failure_rate"  
      threshold: "5%"
      alert: "ops-team"
```
