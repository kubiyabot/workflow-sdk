## Workflow Building Blocks

The workflow designer provides powerful executor nodes that serve as building blocks for your automation:

### üîß [Core Executors](/composer/workflow-designer/core-executors)
Essential execution nodes for AI agents, system commands, and containerized tools:
- **AI Agent** - Intelligent task execution with custom instructions
- **Command** - Shell command execution with timeout controls  
- **Tool (Docker)** - Containerized applications with full isolation

### üîå [Integration Executors](/composer/workflow-designer/integration-executors)
Connect to external APIs, services, and remote systems:
- **HTTP Request** - REST API calls and webhook notifications
- **Kubiya API** - Platform integration for secrets and resources
- **Slack** - Team communication and file sharing
- **SSH** - Remote server execution and management

### üìä [Data Processing Executors](/composer/workflow-designer/data-processing-executors)
Transform and analyze data with AI and JSON processing:
- **LLM Completion** - AI-powered content generation and analysis
- **jq Processor** - Precise JSON data transformation and extraction

### üèóÔ∏è [Workflow Examples](/composer/workflow-designer/workflow-examples)
Complete automation patterns and assembly guides:
- **CI/CD Pipelines** - End-to-end deployment automation
- **Incident Response** - Automated detection and mitigation
- **Data Processing** - Multi-source analytics and reporting

## How to create a workflow

1. **Click "Workflows" ‚Üí "Create New"** in the left sidebar
2. **Drag components** from the left panel onto the canvas
3. **Connect them** by dragging from output to input
4. **Configure each step** by clicking and filling in the details
5. **Test it** with the "Execute Workflow" button

## Common workflow patterns

**Deployment workflow:**
- Trigger: GitHub webhook
- Step 1: Build Docker image  
- Step 2: Deploy to Kubernetes
- Step 3: Send Slack notification

**Monitoring workflow:**
- Trigger: Schedule (every 5 minutes)
- Step 1: Check service health
- Step 2: If unhealthy ‚Üí restart service
- Step 3: Log results

**Security workflow:**
- Trigger: New repository
- Step 1: Run security scan
- Step 2: Create GitHub issue if vulnerabilities found
- Step 3: Notify security team

## Testing your workflow

![Complex Workflow Execution](/assets/screenshots/composer/workflow-designer/complex-workflow-execution.png)

1. **Click "Execute Workflow"** in the top toolbar
2. **Watch it run** - each step shows progress in real-time
3. **Check the results** - see outputs, logs, and any errors
4. **Fix issues** - edit steps and test again

## Sharing workflows

- **Save** - Store for later use
- **Publish** - Make available to your team  
- **Export** - Download as YAML file
- **Fork** - Create a copy to modify
