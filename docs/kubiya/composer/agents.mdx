# Agents & Configuration

AI agents are the intelligent entities that execute tasks, interact with users, and orchestrate complex workflows in Composer. This guide covers agent types, configuration, customization, and management.

## Understanding AI Agents

### What Are AI Agents?
AI agents in Composer are specialized AI systems that:
- **Understand Natural Language**: Process user requests in conversational form
- **Execute Tools**: Use available tools to perform specific operations
- **Maintain Context**: Remember conversation history and task state
- **Make Decisions**: Choose appropriate tools and actions based on context
- **Learn and Adapt**: Improve performance based on feedback and usage patterns

### Agent Architecture
```yaml
Agent Components:
  Core LLM: Large Language Model for understanding and reasoning
  Tool Interface: Access to available tools and integrations
  Memory System: Conversation and task context storage
  Planning Engine: Multi-step task planning and execution
  Safety Guards: Security and compliance enforcement
  Monitoring: Performance tracking and error handling
```

## Built-in Agent Types

Composer provides several pre-configured agent types optimized for different use cases:
