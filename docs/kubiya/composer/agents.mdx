AI agents are intelligent assistants that understand your infrastructure and can execute tasks across your tools and systems.

## What agents can do

**Infrastructure tasks:**
- Deploy applications and manage services
- Scale resources up or down based on demand
- Monitor system health and performance
- Troubleshoot issues and run diagnostics

**Development tasks:**
- Create and merge pull requests
- Run tests and CI/CD pipelines
- Manage repositories and branches
- Generate and review code

**Operations tasks:**
- Manage user access and permissions
- Handle incident response workflows
- Create and update documentation
- Coordinate team notifications

## How agents work

1. **You describe what you want** in natural language
2. **Agent understands the context** of your infrastructure  
3. **Agent selects the right tools** from your connected integrations
4. **Agent executes safely** with confirmations for destructive changes
5. **Agent reports back** with results and suggestions

## Agent types

**General Purpose Agent** - Handles most common infrastructure and development tasks.

**Specialized Agents** - Focused on specific domains:
- **DevOps Agent** - Deployments, monitoring, infrastructure
- **Security Agent** - Compliance, vulnerability scans, access control  
- **Data Agent** - Database queries, ETL, analytics
- **Support Agent** - Troubleshooting, documentation, user help

## Customizing agents

**Add tools:** Connect new integrations to expand what agents can do.

**Set permissions:** Control which resources agents can access.

**Create workflows:** Save successful task patterns as reusable automation.

**Train on your setup:** Agents learn from your infrastructure and naming patterns.

## Safety features

- **Confirmation prompts** before destructive operations
- **Permission boundaries** - agents can't exceed your access rights
- **Audit logs** of all agent actions
- **Rollback capabilities** for supported operations

**New to agents?** Start by asking simple questions like *"What services are running?"* or *"Show me recent deployments"*.
