# Collaboration in the Composer

Kubiya Composer enables teams to design and iterate on workflows together.  With real‑time presence, collaborative editing and rich commenting, you can build complex automations without waiting on asynchronous hand‑offs.

## Real‑time presence and editing

When collaboration is enabled on a workflow, each participant joins a **Supabase Realtime** channel keyed by the workflow ID.  The channel broadcasts:

* **Presence updates** – Each client sends periodic heartbeat messages containing cursor coordinates and the currently selected node.  Other collaborators see colored cursors with the user’s initials as they move around the canvas【860359785325647†L47-L107】.
* **Workflow operations** – Actions such as adding, updating or deleting nodes and edges are sent through the channel so all clients maintain the same graph【860359785325647†L110-L160】.  Conflicts are resolved on the server to ensure deterministic ordering.

Joining or leaving a collaboration session is handled by the Composer automatically, but you can also join or leave via the `/api/workflows/<id>/collaborate` endpoint in the backend if you’re integrating with other tools【860359785325647†L64-L107】.

## Comments and discussions

The **Comments** sidebar allows you to annotate workflows or individual chat messages.  Features include:

* **Threaded comments** – Start a new comment thread or reply to an existing one.  Replies are indented for context.
* **Selections** – Highlight a region of a conversation or select a node in the DAG to attach a comment.  The sidebar groups comments by selection【679700562295946†L67-L183】.
* **Resolution state** – Mark a comment as resolved once addressed.  You can toggle between showing unresolved and all comments.
* **Mentions** – Use `@name` to mention teammates (coming soon).  Mentions will send email notifications.

Only collaborators with access to the workflow can see comments.  Comments are stored in your Supabase project, so they persist across sessions.

## Hand‑over and audit trail

The collaboration subsystem records all operations and comments.  You can export a **workflow history** to see who made which changes and when.  This audit trail is essential for regulated environments and debugging.

## Tips for effective collaboration

* Enable collaboration only when you’re ready to work with others.  Real‑time editing can be distracting if you’re still experimenting.
* Use comments to ask questions or flag issues instead of modifying the DSL directly.  This makes it easier to track decisions.
* Resolve comments when completed to keep the sidebar tidy.
* Combine collaboration with version control by exporting workflows and committing them to your Git repository.

With these tools, teams can rapidly co‑design workflows and ensure that everyone understands the automation before it runs.
