## What can you do?

**For immediate tasks:**
- **[Start a conversation →](/composer/task-chat)** Chat with AI agents to execute tasks in natural language
- **[Browse workflows →](/composer/workflow-designer)** Run existing automations with one click

**For building automation:**
- **[Design workflows →](/composer/workflow-designer)** Drag-and-drop visual workflow builder
- **[Connect tools →](/composer/tools)** Integrate with GitHub, AWS, Kubernetes, and more
- **[Explore resources →](/composer/context-graph)** Discover connections across your infrastructure

**For team management:**
- **[Configure settings →](/composer/settings)** Manage users, permissions, and integrations
- **[Monitor activity →](/composer/features/dashboard)** Track execution history and performance

## How it works

1. **Describe what you need** - Use natural language to tell an AI agent what you want to accomplish
2. **Watch it happen** - The agent selects appropriate tools and executes your request step-by-step  
3. **Build workflows** - Turn successful tasks into reusable visual workflows
4. **Scale across your team** - Share workflows and collaborate on complex automations
