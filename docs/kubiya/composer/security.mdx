Security & Secrets management ensures your sensitive information is stored securely and accessed safely by agents and workflows.

![Secrets Vault Overview](/assets/screenshots/composer/security/secrets-vault-overview.png)

## Secrets Vault

The Secrets Vault provides encrypted storage for sensitive information:

- **API Keys** - Service authentication tokens and keys
- **Database Credentials** - Connection strings and passwords  
- **Configuration Tokens** - Integration-specific authentication
- **Application Keys** - Custom application secrets
- **Environment Variables** - Sensitive configuration values

## Managing Secrets

**Adding Secrets:**
1. Navigate to **Resources** â†’ **Secrets Vault**
2. Click **Add Secret**
3. Enter a descriptive name
4. Provide the secret value
5. Set expiration date (optional)
6. Configure access permissions

**Secret Types:**

**API Keys:**
- `CONFIGCAT_API_PASS` - Feature flag management
- `CONFIGCAT_API_USER` - User authentication tokens
- `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` - Data platform access
- `DATADOG_API_KEY` - Monitoring service keys
- `DATADOG_APP_KEY` - Application-specific tokens

**Configuration Tokens:**
- `CONFIGCAT_TOKEN` - Configuration management
- `CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN` - Documentation access

All secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit, with access controlled through role-based permissions.

## Security Features

**Encryption:**
- AES-256 encryption for all stored secrets
- Encrypted communication channels
- Zero-trust architecture principles

**Access Control:**
- Role-based permissions system
- Least-privilege access principles
- Time-limited access tokens
- Audit trails for all secret access

**Rotation:**
- Automatic secret expiration
- Manual rotation workflows
- Integration with external secret managers
- Notification alerts for expiring secrets

## Using Secrets in Workflows

Secrets are automatically injected into workflows and tools:

```yaml
# Example workflow using secrets
steps:
  - name: deploy_app
    tool: kubernetes_deploy
    secrets:
      - KUBECONFIG_TOKEN
      - DOCKER_REGISTRY_KEY
```

**Best Practices:**
- Never hardcode secrets in workflow definitions
- Use descriptive names for easy identification
- Set appropriate expiration dates
- Regularly audit secret usage

## Integration Security

**Secure Connections:**
- TLS encryption for all integrations
- Certificate validation and pinning
- Mutual authentication where supported

**Permission Scoping:**
- Minimal required permissions for each integration
- Regular permission audits
- Automatic permission reviews

**Network Security:**
- VPC/network isolation
- Firewall rules and security groups
- IP allowlisting for sensitive integrations

## Compliance & Auditing

**Audit Logs:**
- Complete audit trail of secret access
- User activity tracking
- Integration usage logging
- Export capabilities for compliance

**Compliance Standards:**
- SOC 2 Type II certified
- GDPR compliant data handling
- Industry-standard encryption
- Regular security assessments

**Data Governance:**
- Data classification and labeling
- Retention policy management
- Geographic data residency options
- Right to deletion compliance

## Security Policies

**Password Requirements:**
- Strong password enforcement
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Session timeout configuration

**Access Policies:**
- IP allowlisting capabilities
- Time-based access restrictions
- Geographic access controls
- Failed login attempt monitoring

**Incident Response:**
- Automated threat detection
- Security event alerting
- Breach notification procedures
- Recovery and remediation workflows

## Monitoring & Alerts

**Security Monitoring:**
- Unusual access pattern detection
- Failed authentication alerts
- Secret exposure scanning
- Integration health monitoring

**Alert Configuration:**
- Real-time security notifications
- Customizable alert thresholds
- Multiple notification channels
- Escalation procedures

## Troubleshooting

**Access Issues:**
- Verify user permissions and roles
- Check secret expiration dates
- Validate integration configurations
- Review audit logs for errors

**Integration Problems:**
- Test secret values and formats
- Confirm network connectivity
- Validate API permissions
- Check service-specific requirements

**Performance Concerns:**
- Monitor secret retrieval latency
- Optimize secret caching strategies
- Review access patterns
- Consider secret consolidation
