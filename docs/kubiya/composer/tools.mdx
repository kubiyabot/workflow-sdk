Tools let AI agents interact with your infrastructure - from AWS and Kubernetes to GitHub and Slack.

The tools marketplace provides a comprehensive catalog of available integrations across different categories.

## Built-in tools

Composer comes with 100+ tools ready to use:

**Cloud platforms:**
- AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
- Deploy, scale, monitor resources
- Manage IAM and security settings

**Development:**
- GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
- Create PRs, run CI/CD, manage repos
- Code analysis and testing

**Infrastructure:**
- Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform
- Deploy containers, manage clusters
- Infrastructure as code

**Communication:**
- Slack, Microsoft Teams, Email
- Send notifications, create channels
- Incident response coordination

**Databases:**
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
- Query data, manage schemas
- Backup and restore operations

## Connecting new tools

1. **Go to Resources** â†’ **New Stack** in the left sidebar
2. **Choose your service** from the integration catalog  
3. **Authenticate** - usually OAuth or API key
4. **Test the connection** to make sure it works
5. **Start using** - agents can now access this tool

## How agents use tools

When you chat with an agent:
1. **Agent understands** what you want to accomplish
2. **Selects appropriate tools** based on your request  
3. **Executes safely** with proper error handling
4. **Shows results** and suggests follow-up actions

Example: *"Deploy my app to staging"*
- Agent uses GitHub tool to fetch latest code
- Uses Docker tool to build container image  
- Uses Kubernetes tool to deploy to staging cluster
- Uses Slack tool to notify team of deployment

## Custom tools

**For standard operations:** Most teams find the built-in tools sufficient.

**For specialized needs:** You can create custom tools using:
- **Docker containers** - Package any script or application
- **API endpoints** - Connect to internal services
- **Shell commands** - Wrap existing scripts
- **Python functions** - Direct code integration

Above is an example of configuring a custom Lambda function tool, showing the required parameters like function name, runtime, role ARN, and handler.

## Managing tool access

**Permissions:** Control which tools each team member can access.

**Secrets:** Store API keys and credentials securely.

**Usage tracking:** See which tools are used most often.

**Health monitoring:** Get alerts when tools become unavailable.

**Getting started?** Connect one tool you use daily first - like GitHub or AWS. Once you see how it works, add more.
