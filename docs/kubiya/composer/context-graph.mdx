See how your infrastructure connects together - understand dependencies before making changes.

## What is the Context Graph?

The Context Graph automatically maps relationships between your:
- **Services** and their dependencies
- **Resources** like databases, queues, storage
- **Infrastructure** components (clusters, networks, etc.)  
- **Deployments** and their configurations

## How to use it

1. **Click "Context Browser"** in the left sidebar
2. **Wait for discovery** - Composer scans your connected tools
3. **Explore the network** - click and drag to navigate
4. **Click on resources** to see details and connections

## Why this helps

**Before making changes:**
- See what services depend on what you're changing
- Understand blast radius of infrastructure updates
- Find related resources you might have forgotten about

**When building workflows:**  
- AI agents get smarter suggestions based on your actual setup
- Discover integration opportunities you didn't know existed
- Avoid breaking dependencies between services

**For troubleshooting:**
- Trace problems across service boundaries
- Find the root cause of cascading failures
- See which teams own which components

## Getting better results

**Connect more tools** - The more integrations you have, the richer the graph becomes.

**Use consistent naming** - Services named consistently show cleaner relationships.

**Tag your resources** - Tags help group related components together.

**Pro tip:** Use the Context Graph before building complex workflows to understand what resources are actually available.
