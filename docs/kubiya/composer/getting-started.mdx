## Step 3: Your First Agent Interaction

Let's start with a simple task to get familiar with the interface.

### Starting a Chat Session
1. Click **"Start New Task"** from the dashboard
2. The task chat interface opens with an AI agent ready to help
3. You'll see:
   - **Chat Input**: Type your requests here
   - **Agent Info**: Current agent capabilities and status
   - **Task History**: Previous interactions in this session

### Example First Task
Try this simple automation:

```
Hello! Can you help me list all the files in my current directory and show me what tools are available?
```

The agent will:
1. Execute the file listing command
2. Show available tools and integrations
3. Provide suggestions for next steps

### Understanding Agent Responses
Agent responses include:
- **Text Messages**: Natural language explanations
- **Tool Executions**: Command outputs and results
- **Artifacts**: Files, reports, or data generated
- **Status Updates**: Progress indicators and completion states

## Step 4: Exploring Tools and Integrations

### Accessing the Tools Catalog
1. Navigate to **"Integrations"** in the main menu
2. Browse available categories:
   - **DevOps Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
   - **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, GCP
   - **Communication**: Slack, Teams, Email
   - **Development**: GitHub, GitLab, CI/CD
   - **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog

### Installing Your First Integration
Let's set up a GitHub integration:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select GitHub Integration">
    Find "GitHub" in the integrations catalog and click **"Install"**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="OAuth Authentication">
    Click **"Connect to GitHub"** and authorize Kubiya in the popup window
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Permissions">
    Select repositories and permissions you want to grant
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Use the built-in test feature to verify the integration works
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using Integrated Tools
Once installed, you can use GitHub tools in chat:

```
Can you create a new pull request for my feature branch in the "my-project" repository?
```

## Step 5: Creating Your First Workflow

### Opening the Workflow Designer
1. Click **"Workflows"** → **"Create New Workflow"**
2. The visual designer opens with:
   - **Node Palette**: Available workflow components
   - **Canvas**: Drag-and-drop design area
   - **Property Panel**: Configure selected nodes
   - **Test Panel**: Execute and debug workflows

### Building a Simple Workflow
Let's create an automated deployment workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Trigger Node">
    Drag a "Webhook Trigger" from the palette to the canvas
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add GitHub Action">
    Connect a "GitHub - Get Repository" node to fetch code
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Build Step">
    Connect a "Docker - Build Image" node for containerization
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Deployment">
    Connect a "Kubernetes - Deploy" node for final deployment
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Properties">
    Click each node and fill in required parameters
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Testing Your Workflow
1. Click **"Test Workflow"** in the toolbar
2. Provide sample input data
3. Watch execution progress in real-time
4. Review outputs and debug any issues

### Saving and Publishing
1. Click **"Save Workflow"** and provide:
   - **Name**: Descriptive workflow name
   - **Description**: Purpose and usage notes
   - **Tags**: Categorization labels
2. Click **"Publish"** to make it available for execution

## Step 6: Understanding the Context Graph

The Context Graph helps you discover and understand relationships between your resources.

### Accessing Context Graph
1. Navigate to **"Context Graph"** from the main menu
2. You'll see a visual representation of:
   - **Connected Services**: Your integrations and tools
   - **Resource Relationships**: How components interact
   - **Data Flow**: Information movement between systems

### Using Context for Better Automation
The Context Graph enables:
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI recommends relevant tools and connections
- **Impact Analysis**: Understand what changes might affect
- **Resource Discovery**: Find available services and capabilities

## Step 7: Managing Settings and Preferences

### Accessing Settings
1. Click your profile icon → **"Settings"**
2. Available tabs include:
   - **General**: Basic preferences and profile information
   - **Integrations**: Manage connected services
   - **API Keys**: Authentication tokens and secrets
   - **Notifications**: Alert preferences and channels
   - **Organization**: Team settings and permissions

### Key Configuration Options

#### API Keys Management
- Store secrets securely for tool integrations
- Set up service account credentials
- Manage token rotation and expiration

#### Notification Settings
- Choose which events trigger notifications
- Configure delivery channels (email, Slack, webhook)
- Set quiet hours and escalation rules

## Step 8: Best Practices and Tips

### Chat Interface Tips
- **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed requests
- **Use Context**: Reference previous tasks and outputs
- **Ask for Explanations**: Request step-by-step breakdowns
- **Save Important Results**: Bookmark useful outputs

### Workflow Design Best Practices
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic workflows and add complexity gradually
- **Use Templates**: Leverage pre-built workflow templates
- **Test Thoroughly**: Always test workflows before production use
- **Document Well**: Add descriptions and comments

### Integration Management
- **Regular Maintenance**: Keep credentials updated and test connections
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Monitor Usage**: Track integration performance and costs
- **Security First**: Regular security audits and access reviews

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Login Problems
- **Clear Browser Cache**: Remove stored authentication data
- **Check SSO Configuration**: Verify identity provider settings
- **Contact Admin**: For organization-level access issues

### Agent Not Responding
- **Check Connection**: Verify network connectivity
- **Refresh Session**: Reload the page or restart chat
- **Review Logs**: Check execution logs for error details

### Integration Failures
- **Verify Credentials**: Check API keys and authentication
- **Test Connections**: Use built-in connection testing
- **Review Permissions**: Ensure adequate access rights
