Complete this 5-minute setup to start automating with AI agents.

## Before you start

You'll need:
- Access to your Kubiya organization 
- Admin permissions (to connect integrations)
- Your infrastructure tools ready (AWS, GitHub, Kubernetes, etc.)

## Step 1: Log in and explore

1. **Go to** `https://compose.kubiya.ai` 
2. **Sign in** with your organization credentials
3. **Select your organization** if you have multiple

You'll see the main interface with:
- **Left sidebar** - Navigation to Tasks, Workflows, Context Graph, etc.
- **Main area** - Task creation and activity feed  
- **Quick actions** - Create Task, Browse Workflows, etc.

*Main Composer interface - ready to create your first task*

## Step 2: Try your first task

1. **Click "Create Task"** in the main interface
2. **Type this example request:**

> "Show me what Kubernetes clusters I have access to and list the pods in the default namespace"

3. **Press Enter** and watch the AI agent:
   - Connect to your Kubernetes tools
   - Execute the commands safely
   - Return live results with explanations

The agent will guide you through any missing permissions or connection issues.

## Step 3: Connect your tools

To unlock Composer's full power, connect your infrastructure tools:

1. **Go to the Resources tab** in the left sidebar
2. **Click "New Stack"** to add integrations
3. **Choose your platform:**
   - **AWS** - Connect your cloud resources
   - **GitHub** - Integrate repositories and CI/CD
   - **Kubernetes** - Manage clusters and workloads  
   - **Slack** - Enable notifications and collaboration

*Manage all your infrastructure connections in one place*

**Pro tip:** Start with one tool you use daily. You can add more later.

## Step 4: Build your first workflow

Turn your successful task into a reusable workflow:

1. **Go to Workflows** â†’ **Create New Workflow**
2. **Drag components** from the left panel to the canvas
3. **Connect them** to define your automation flow
4. **Test it** with the "Execute Workflow" button

*Drag-and-drop workflow builder - no coding required*

**Example workflow:** "Deploy on GitHub push"
- Trigger: GitHub webhook  
- Action 1: Build Docker image
- Action 2: Deploy to Kubernetes
- Action 3: Send Slack notification

*Watch your workflow execute in real-time with detailed progress tracking*

## Step 5: Explore your infrastructure

Use the Context Graph to understand your connected systems:

1. **Click "Context Browser"** in the left sidebar
2. **Watch Composer discover** your infrastructure automatically
3. **Explore the network view** to see how everything connects

![Context Network](/assets/screenshots/composer/context-graph/context-network-view.png)
*Interactive map showing relationships between all your connected resources*

This helps you:
- **Understand dependencies** before making changes
- **Find related resources** when building workflows
- **Get AI suggestions** based on your actual infrastructure

## You're ready! ðŸŽ‰

That's it! You now know how to:
- âœ… Chat with AI agents to execute tasks
- âœ… Connect your infrastructure tools  
- âœ… Build visual workflows
- âœ… Explore your system relationships

## What's next?

**Start automating:** Try these common use cases:
- *"Deploy my latest commit to staging"*
- *"Scale up my production pods to 5 replicas"*  
- *"Create a PR for the bug fix in feature-branch"*
- *"Show me which services are using the most CPU"*
