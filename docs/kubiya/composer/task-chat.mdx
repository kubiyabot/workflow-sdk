Chat with AI agents using natural language to get work done - no commands to memorize.

The task creation interface provides template categories and suggestions to help you get started quickly:

Once you submit a task, the agent begins processing your request:

The system generates workflow artifacts and displays the results:

## How to start a chat

1. **Click "Tasks" â†’ "Create Task"** in the left sidebar
2. **Type what you want to do** in plain English
3. **Press Enter** and watch the agent work
4. **Ask follow-up questions** or request changes

## What you can ask for

**Infrastructure tasks:**
- *"List all pods in the production namespace"*
- *"Scale up my web service to 5 replicas"*
- *"Deploy the latest commit to staging"*

**Development tasks:**
- *"Create a pull request for my feature branch"*
- *"Run the test suite and show me the results"*  
- *"Find all TODO comments in the codebase"*

**Monitoring tasks:**
- *"Show me CPU usage for the last hour"*
- *"Check if all services are healthy"*
- *"Alert me when disk space is low"*

## Understanding agent responses

The agent will:
- **Explain what it's doing** before taking action
- **Show command outputs** and results in real-time
- **Ask for confirmation** before making changes
- **Provide suggestions** for follow-up tasks

## Advanced features

**Save tasks as workflows:**
Click "Save as Workflow" to turn successful tasks into reusable automation.

**Share conversations:**  
Use the share button to send task results to teammates.

**Upload files:**
Drag and drop files to analyze, process, or deploy them.

## Tips for better results

- **Be specific** - "Deploy v2.1.0 to staging" vs "deploy something"
- **Provide context** - mention which environment, repository, or service
- **Ask questions** - "What would happen if I scale down to 0 replicas?"
- **Request explanations** - "Why did that command fail?"

**New to this?** Try simple tasks first like *"show me what tools are available"* or *"list my repositories"*.
