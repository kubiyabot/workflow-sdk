The Task Chat interface allows you to interact with AI agents to create and execute workflows using natural language. The agent processes your requests and generates executable workflows.

## Starting a Chat Session

1. Access the Tasks interface in the Kubiya Composer
2. Enter your request in natural language
3. The AI agent will process your request and generate a workflow
4. Review and execute the generated workflow

## Example Requests

**Infrastructure Operations:**
```
List all pods in the production namespace
Scale my web service to 5 replicas
Deploy the latest version to staging
```

**Development Workflows:**
```
Create a CI/CD pipeline for my Node.js app
Run tests and generate a coverage report
Build and push Docker image to registry
```

**Monitoring and Alerts:**
```
Check system health across all services
Generate performance metrics report
Set up alerts for high CPU usage
```

## Understanding agent responses

The agent will:
- **Explain what it's doing** before taking action
- **Show command outputs** and results in real-time
- **Ask for confirmation** before making changes
- **Provide suggestions** for follow-up tasks

## Advanced features

**Save tasks as workflows:**
Click "Save as Workflow" to turn successful tasks into reusable automation.

**Share conversations:**  
Use the share button to send task results to teammates.

**Upload files:**
Drag and drop files to analyze, process, or deploy them.

## Tips for better results

- **Be specific** - "Deploy v2.1.0 to staging" vs "deploy something"
- **Provide context** - mention which environment, repository, or service
- **Ask questions** - "What would happen if I scale down to 0 replicas?"
- **Request explanations** - "Why did that command fail?"

**New to this?** Try simple tasks first like *"show me what tools are available"* or *"list my repositories"*.
