# Task Chat & Agent Interaction

The Task Chat interface is Composer's primary interaction method with AI agents. It provides a natural language interface for creating, monitoring, and managing automated tasks in real-time.

## Interface Overview

### Chat Layout Components

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Message Area" icon="message">
    Scrollable conversation history with user messages and agent responses
  </Card>
  <Card title="Input Panel" icon="keyboard">
    Text input area with formatting tools and attachment options
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent Info Panel" icon="robot">
    Current agent details, capabilities, and status information
  </Card>
  <Card title="Task Status Bar" icon="progress">
    Real-time execution progress and status indicators
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Agent Information Display
The agent panel shows:
- **Name**: "DevOps Assistant"
- **Status**: üü¢ Available
- **Capabilities**: Infrastructure, Deployment, Monitoring
- **Tools Available**: 47
- **Response Time**: ~2.3s average
- **Success Rate**: 94.7%

## Starting a Task Chat

### Creating a New Chat Session

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Tasks">
    Click **"Tasks"** in the main navigation or use the **"Start New Task"** quick action
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Agent (Optional)">
    Choose a specific agent or let the system auto-select based on your request
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Begin Conversation">
    Type your request in natural language and press Enter or click **"Send"**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Opening Messages
Here are effective ways to start different types of tasks:

#### Infrastructure Management
```
"I need to deploy a new microservice to our Kubernetes cluster. 
The image is my-app:v2.1.0 and it needs 3 replicas with load balancing."
```

#### Data Operations  
```
"Can you help me analyze the logs from yesterday's production incident? 
I need to identify error patterns and affected users."
```

#### Development Tasks
```
"Create a new feature branch called 'user-authentication' and 
set up the initial project structure with authentication middleware."
```

## Message Types and Formatting

### Text Messages
Standard conversational messages for:
- Task requests and clarifications
- Progress updates and confirmations
- Questions and troubleshooting

### Rich Message Features

#### Code Blocks
Agents can display formatted code:
````markdown
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
```
````

#### Interactive Elements
- **Action Buttons**: Quick response options
- **File Downloads**: Generated reports and configs
- **Links**: Related resources and documentation
- **Tables**: Structured data display

#### Tool Execution Display
When agents execute tools, you'll see:
- **üîß Tool**: kubectl-deploy
- **‚ö° Status**: Running...
- **üìù Command**: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml  
- **‚è±Ô∏è Duration**: 00:00:15
- **‚úÖ Result**: Deployment successful

## Agent Response Types

### Confirmation Responses
Agents will ask for confirmation before:
- Making changes to production systems
- Deleting resources or data
- Executing potentially dangerous operations
- Spending budget or resources

Example:
```
Agent: "I'm ready to deploy the application to production. This will:
       - Update the running containers with version 2.1.0
       - Restart 3 pods with brief downtime (~30 seconds)
       - Update the load balancer configuration
       
       Should I proceed with the deployment? (Yes/No)"
```

### Progress Updates
For long-running tasks, agents provide regular updates:
```
Agent: "üîÑ Step 1/4: Pulling container image (Complete)
       üîÑ Step 2/4: Validating configuration (Complete)  
       ‚ö° Step 3/4: Rolling out deployment (In Progress - 2/3 pods ready)
       ‚è≥ Step 4/4: Updating load balancer (Pending)"
```

### Error Handling
When issues occur, agents provide:
- **Clear Error Description**: What went wrong
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Why it happened  
- **Resolution Options**: How to fix it
- **Prevention Suggestions**: Avoid future issues

## Advanced Chat Features

### Multi-Turn Conversations
Maintain context across multiple exchanges:

```
User: "Deploy the user service to staging"
Agent: "Deployment completed. 3 pods are running and healthy."

User: "Now run the integration tests"  
Agent: "Running tests against the newly deployed staging environment..."

User: "If tests pass, promote to production"
Agent: "Tests passed! Promoting to production with the same configuration..."
```

### Context References
Reference previous tasks and results:
- **"Use the same configuration as before"**
- **"Apply this to the database we set up yesterday"**
- **"Check the logs from the previous deployment"**

### Follow-up Tasks
Chain related operations naturally:
```
User: "Set up monitoring for the new service"
Agent: "I've configured Prometheus scraping and Grafana dashboards. 
       Would you like me to set up alerting rules as well?"

User: "Yes, alert if response time exceeds 500ms or error rate is above 1%"
Agent: "Alerting rules configured. I'll also set up PagerDuty integration 
       for critical alerts. Should I create an incident response runbook?"
```

## Task Execution Monitoring

### Real-Time Status Tracking
The interface provides live updates on:

#### Execution Progress
- **Task Status**: "Deployment in Progress"
- **Current Step**: "Rolling Update (2/3 pods ready)"
- **Estimated Time**: "30 seconds remaining"

## Best Practices for Task Chat

### Effective Communication

#### Be Specific and Clear
‚ùå **Vague**: "Fix the deployment issue"
‚úÖ **Specific**: "The user-service deployment is failing on pod startup with a database connection error. Please investigate and resolve."

#### Provide Context
‚ùå **No Context**: "Update the configuration"
‚úÖ **With Context**: "Update the production nginx configuration to handle the increased traffic we're seeing since yesterday's marketing campaign launch."

#### Use Structured Requests
For complex tasks, break them down:
```
"I need to set up a new microservice with these requirements:
1. Deploy to staging environment first
2. Configure auto-scaling (2-10 pods based on CPU usage)
3. Set up health checks on /health endpoint
4. Enable logging to our centralized ELK stack
5. Create monitoring dashboards in Grafana"
```

### Security Considerations

#### Sensitive Information
- **Never share passwords or API keys in chat**
- **Use environment variables for secrets**
- **Reference secret names instead of values**
- **Enable audit logging for compliance**

#### Permission Awareness
Understand agent capabilities and limitations:
- **Production Access**: Confirm agent has appropriate permissions
- **Resource Limits**: Be aware of quotas and constraints
- **Approval Workflows**: Some operations may require human approval

## Troubleshooting Chat Issues

### Common Problems

#### Agent Not Responding
```yaml
Possible Causes:
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Agent overload or maintenance
  - Authentication problems
  - Rate limiting active

Solutions:
  - Refresh the chat session
  - Try a different agent
  - Check system status page
  - Contact support if persistent
```

#### Task Execution Failures
```yaml
Debugging Steps:
  1. Review error messages in chat
  2. Check execution logs for details
  3. Verify permissions and access
  4. Confirm resource availability
  5. Try with simpler test case
```

#### Chat Performance Issues
```yaml
Optimization Tips:
  - Clear browser cache and cookies
  - Limit concurrent chat sessions
  - Archive old conversations
  - Use specific rather than broad requests
```
