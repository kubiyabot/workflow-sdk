## Why AI Automation Fails in Production

Current AI agents and automation scripts face critical challenges in production environments:

- **Unpredictable Behavior**: Pure AI approaches can produce different results for the same input
- **Security Risks**: Uncontrolled AI agents can access sensitive systems without proper governance  
- **Maintenance Burden**: Fragile scripts break when systems change, requiring constant updates
- **Lack of Trust**: Teams can't rely on "black box" automation for critical operations

## Kubiya's Approach: AI Understanding + Deterministic Workflows

Kubiya solves these problems by combining AI's natural language understanding with deterministic, containerized execution:

## Key Benefits for Engineering Teams

### For Platform Engineers
- **Reliable Automation**: Deterministic workflows ensure consistent behavior across environments
- **Security & Compliance**: Containerized execution with audit trails and policy enforcement
- **Reduced Maintenance**: Self-healing integrations adapt to API changes automatically

### For SREs & DevOps
- **Faster Incident Response**: AI-assisted troubleshooting with safe, automated remediation
- **Reduced Toil**: Automate repetitive tasks while maintaining control and visibility  
- **Cross-Environment Operations**: Orchestrate actions across multiple clusters and cloud providers

### for Developers
- **Self-Service Workflows**: Enable team members to perform operations without manual intervention
- **ChatOps Integration**: Natural language commands in Slack, Teams, or web interfaces
- **Extensible Platform**: Build custom automations using familiar tools and APIs

  <Step title="Execute Safely">
    Containerized tools run deterministic operations on your infrastructure with full audit trails
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Production-Ready from Day One

Unlike experimental AI frameworks, Kubiya is built for production environments:

- **Enterprise Security**: SOC2 compliant with encryption at rest and in transit
- **Scalable Architecture**: Runs on your infrastructure or Kubiya's managed platform
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Full observability into all automation activities
- **Policy Enforcement**: Fine-grained controls over what actions can be performed

<Note>
Kubiya doesn't replace your existing toolsâ€”it orchestrates them intelligently while maintaining security and reliability standards your team already requires.
