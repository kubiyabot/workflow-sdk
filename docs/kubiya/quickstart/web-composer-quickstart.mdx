Experience Kubiya's full power through the web interfaceâ€”no installation required. You'll create your first automation, see it execute in real-time, and save it as a reusable workflow.

## Step 1: Access the Platform

Visit [compose.kubiya.ai](https://compose.kubiya.ai) and sign in with your preferred method:

<img

  alt="Kubiya Composer Main Interface"
  caption="The Composer dashboard - your central hub for AI-powered automation"
/>

<Note>
**First time signing up?** You'll get immediate access to explore the platform with sample integrations and a hosted runner. No credit card required.
</Note>

## Step 2: Create Your First Task

Click **"New Task"** to open the AI chat interface where you can describe your automation in natural language.

<img
  src="/assets/images/task_creation_ai_model_selection.png"
  alt="Task Creation with AI Model Selection"
  caption="Choose your AI model and describe what you want to automate"
/>

Try one of these starter prompts:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Infrastructure Health">
    ```
    Check the health of my Kubernetes cluster and 
    send a summary to the #devops Slack channel
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Application Deployment">
    ```
    Deploy the latest version of my app to staging
    and run health checks to verify it's working
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Incident Response">
    ```
    Gather logs from the last 30 minutes for services
    showing high error rates and create a summary report
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Watch AI Generate Your Workflow

As you type, Kubiya's AI understands your intent and begins generating a structured workflow. You'll see:

1. **Available Integrations** - Tools and services Kubiya can access
2. **Context Discovery** - Information about your infrastructure 
3. **Workflow Generation** - Step-by-step automation plan

/>

<img

  alt="Tools Selection Interface"
  caption="Select which tools your workflow should use"
/>

## Step 4: Execute and Monitor

Once your workflow is generated, click **"Run"** to execute it. You'll see:

- **Real-time Progress**: Each step executes with live updates
- **Execution Logs**: Detailed output from every operation
- **Visual Timeline**: Clear view of workflow progression

<img
  src="/assets/images/workflow_execution_timeline.png"
  alt="Workflow Execution Timeline"
  caption="Track your workflow's progress with detailed timeline view"
/>

<img
  src="/assets/images/workflow_step_output_logs.png"
  alt="Step Output and Logs"
  caption="View detailed logs and output from each workflow step"
/>

## Step 5: Save as Reusable Workflow

When your task completes successfully, save it as a workflow for future use:

<img
  src="/assets/images/workflow_publisher_dialog.png"
  alt="Workflow Publisher Dialog"
  caption="Save your successful automation as a reusable workflow"
/>

Your saved workflow can be:
- **Triggered manually** by team members
- **Scheduled** to run automatically  
- **Invoked via webhooks** from other systems
- **Called from Slack/Teams** for ChatOps

## Step 6: Explore the Visual Builder

For more complex automations, use the drag-and-drop workflow designer:

  alt="Visual Workflow Designer"
  caption="Build complex workflows with the visual designer"
/>

<img
  src="/assets/images/workflow_designer_node_library.png"
  alt="Workflow Designer Node Library"
  caption="Drag components from the library to build your workflow"
/>

The designer includes:
- **Pre-built Components** for common operations
- **Conditional Logic** for decision points
- **Parallel Execution** for performance
- **Error Handling** for reliability

  src="/assets/images/workflow_designer_with_ai_assistant.png"
  alt="Workflow Designer with AI Assistant"
  caption="Get AI help while building workflows visually"
/>

## Understanding Your Infrastructure Context

Kubiya automatically maps your infrastructure to provide intelligent suggestions:

<img

  alt="Infrastructure Context Network View"
  caption="Kubiya's context graph shows relationships between your systems"
/>

<img
  src="/assets/images/context_catalog_3d_visualization.png"
  alt="3D Infrastructure Visualization"
  caption="Interactive 3D view of your infrastructure relationships"
/>

This context helps Kubiya:
- Suggest relevant operations based on your setup
- Understand dependencies between services
- Provide safe automation with awareness of blast radius
- Generate workflows specific to your environment

## Managing Integrations and Secrets

Set up connections to your tools through the integrations panel:

  caption="Secure credential storage for all your integrations"
/>

<img
