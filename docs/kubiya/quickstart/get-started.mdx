## What You'll Experience

Regardless of which path you choose, you'll see how Kubiya:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understands Natural Language">
    Describe what you want in plain English: "Deploy my app to staging" or "Scale down the test environment"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generates Deterministic Workflows">
    Watch as your request becomes a structured, repeatable workflow with safety checks
  </Step>
  <Step title="Executes Safely">
    See containerized tools perform operations with real-time feedback and audit trails
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provides Full Visibility">
    Monitor execution, view logs, and understand exactly what happened
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick Demo: First Automation

Here's a preview of what you'll build in the next 5 minutes:

<CodeGroup>

```bash CLI Example
# Install and authenticate
kubiya auth login

# Run your first automation
kubiya task run "Show me the health of my production cluster"

# Save successful operations as reusable workflows
kubiya workflow save "cluster-health-check"
```

```python SDK Example
from kubiya_sdk import Kubiya

# Initialize client
client = Kubiya(api_key="your-api-key")

# Generate and execute workflow
result = client.compose(
    goal="Check cluster health and send summary to Slack",
    mode="act"  # Execute immediately
)

print(result.workflow_execution.status)
```

```yaml Generated Workflow
name: cluster-health-check
steps:
  - name: get-cluster-status
    tool: kubectl
    args: ["get", "nodes", "-o", "json"]
    
  - name: check-pod-health  
    tool: kubectl
    args: ["get", "pods", "--all-namespaces"]
    
  - name: send-slack-summary
    tool: slack
    channel: "#ops-alerts"
    message: "Cluster health check complete ✅"
```

</CodeGroup>

## What's Next?

After completing your quickstart:

1. **Explore Core Concepts**: Understand [how integrations work](/core-concepts/integrations) and why [workflows are deterministic](/core-concepts/workflows)

2. **Try Real Use Cases**: Check out [common automation patterns](/core-concepts/use-cases) like deployments, incident response, and infrastructure management

3. **Customize Your Setup**: Learn about [runners](/core-concepts/runners) for on-premises execution and [AI models](/core-concepts/ai-models) for different providers

4. **Go Production**: Review our [deployment guide](/admin/deployment-guide) and [security best practices](/admin/security-access)

<Note>
**New to AI automation?** No problem! Our interfaces are designed to be intuitive whether you're an AI expert or just getting started. The workflows Kubiya generates are transparent and easy to understand.
