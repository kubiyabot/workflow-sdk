# AI Providers Overview

The Kubiya Workflow SDK includes a pluggable provider system that enables AI-powered workflow generation from natural language descriptions. Providers bridge the gap between what you want to accomplish and the technical implementation.

## What are Providers?

Providers are AI frameworks that:
- Generate workflows from natural language task descriptions
- Validate and refine generated workflows
- Optionally execute workflows with real-time streaming
- Handle errors and retry logic automatically

## How Providers Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Task Description">
    You provide a natural language description of what you want to accomplish
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Context Loading">
    The provider loads available resources, integrations, and platform capabilities
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Workflow Generation">
    AI models generate the workflow code based on your requirements
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Validation & Refinement">
    The generated code is validated and refined if needed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Execution (Optional)">
    In "act" mode, the workflow is immediately executed with streaming updates
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Provider Interface

All providers implement a common interface:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Dict, Any, AsyncIterator

class BaseProvider(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def generate_workflow(
        self, 
        task: str, 
        context: Dict[str, Any]
    ) -> Workflow:
        """Generate a workflow from task description."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def validate_workflow(
        self, 
        workflow: Workflow
    ) -> ValidationResult:
        """Validate workflow syntax and logic."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def compose(
        self,
        task: str,
        mode: str = "plan",
        stream: bool = False,
        **kwargs
    ) -> Union[Dict, AsyncIterator[Dict]]:
        """Main entry point for workflow composition."""
        pass
```

## Using Providers

### Basic Usage

```python
from kubiya_workflow_sdk.providers import get_provider

# Get a provider instance
provider = get_provider("adk")

# Generate a workflow
result = await provider.compose(
    task="Create a backup workflow for PostgreSQL database",
    mode="plan"
)

workflow = result["workflow"]
```

### Streaming Generation

```python
# Stream the generation process
async for event in provider.compose(
    task="Deploy application with health checks",
    mode="act",
    stream=True
):
    if event["type"] == "text":
        print(f"AI: {event['content']}")
    elif event["type"] == "execution":
        print(f"Executing: {event['data']}")
```

### With Custom Context

```python
# Provide additional context
result = await provider.compose(
    task="Create monitoring workflow",
    context={
        "monitoring_tool": "prometheus",
        "alert_channel": "#ops-alerts",
        "check_interval": "5m"
    },
    mode="plan"
)
```

## Provider Modes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Plan Mode">
    Generate workflows without executing them. Perfect for:
    - Reviewing generated workflows before execution
    - Saving workflows for later use
    - Learning how the AI interprets your requirements
    
    ```python
    result = await provider.compose(task="...", mode="plan")
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Act Mode">
    Generate and immediately execute workflows. Ideal for:
    - One-time automation tasks
    - Quick operations that don't need review
    - Interactive workflow development
    
    ```python
    result = await provider.compose(task="...", mode="act")
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

Providers can be configured through environment variables or programmatically:

### Environment Variables

```bash
# ADK Provider
export TOGETHER_API_KEY="your-key"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"  # Optional

# General settings
export PROVIDER_TIMEOUT=300
export PROVIDER_MAX_RETRIES=3
```

### Programmatic Configuration

```python
from kubiya_workflow_sdk.providers.adk import ADKProviderConfig

config = ADKProviderConfig(
    model_provider="together",
    max_loop_iterations=3,
    timeout=300,
    stream_format="sse"
)

provider = get_provider("adk", config=config)
```

## Creating Custom Providers

You can create your own provider by extending the base class:

```python
from kubiya_workflow_sdk.providers import BaseProvider, register_provider

@register_provider("my-provider")
class MyCustomProvider(BaseProvider):
    async def generate_workflow(self, task: str, context: Dict):
        # Your implementation
        pass
    
    async def validate_workflow(self, workflow: Workflow):
        # Your validation logic
        pass
    
    async def compose(self, task: str, **kwargs):
        # Main composition logic
        pass
```
