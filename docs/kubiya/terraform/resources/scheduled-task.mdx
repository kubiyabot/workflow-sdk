The `kubiya_scheduled_task` resource allows you to create and manage scheduled tasks in the Kubiya platform. Scheduled tasks execute Kubiya agents on defined schedules using cron expressions, enabling automated recurring operations for monitoring, reporting, maintenance, and other routine activities.

<Tip>
Scheduled tasks are essential for automating recurring operations like health checks, backups, reports, and maintenance tasks, ensuring consistent operations without manual intervention.
</Tip>

## Prerequisites

Before using this resource, ensure you have:

1. A Kubiya account with API access
2. An API key (generated from Kubiya dashboard under Admin â†’ Kubiya API Keys)
3. At least one configured agent to execute
4. Understanding of cron expression syntax

## Compatibility

<Note>
**Requirements:**
- Kubiya Terraform Provider version >= 1.0.0
- Terraform >= 1.0
- Cron expressions are evaluated in UTC by default
- Agent must exist and be accessible before task creation
</Note>

<Warning>
**Limitations:**
- Minimum schedule frequency may be limited by platform tier
- Very frequent schedules (e.g., every minute) may be subject to rate limiting
- Task execution time limits apply based on your platform configuration
- Notification delivery depends on integration configuration
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Schedule Not Executing">
  - Verify the cron expression syntax is correct
  - Check that the task is enabled
  - Ensure the agent exists and is accessible
  - Review timezone considerations (schedules run in UTC)
  - Check platform limits on schedule frequency
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Agent Execution Issues">
  - Verify the agent name exactly matches an existing agent
  - Check that the agent has proper permissions and integrations
  - Ensure the prompt is clear and actionable
  - Review agent instructions for task compatibility
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Notification Problems">
  - Verify notification method configuration
  - Check destination format (channels, emails, URLs)
  - Ensure integrations are properly configured
  - Test notification channels independently
</Accordion>
