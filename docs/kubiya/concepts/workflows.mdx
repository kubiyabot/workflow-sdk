Workflows are sequences of automated steps that accomplish complex tasks safely and reliably.

## What workflows do

**Automate multi-step processes:**
- Deploy applications through multiple environments
- Run security scans and respond to findings
- Process data through multiple transformation stages
- Coordinate actions across multiple systems

**Connect different tools:**
- Get code from GitHub, build with Docker, deploy to Kubernetes
- Monitor with Prometheus, alert via Slack, create Jira tickets
- Query databases, generate reports, send via email

**Handle complex logic:**
- If-then-else conditions based on results
- Retry failed operations with exponential backoff
- Parallel execution where possible
- Error handling and rollback procedures

## How workflows work

1. **Define the steps** - What needs to happen in what order
2. **Set dependencies** - Which steps must complete before others start
3. **Configure each step** - What tools to use and how
4. **Run the workflow** - Execute manually, on schedule, or triggered by events
5. **Monitor progress** - See real-time status and detailed logs

## Key benefits

**Safety:** Each step runs in its own isolated container, preventing conflicts and ensuring clean environments.

**Reliability:** Same inputs always produce the same outputs. No surprises in production.

**Visibility:** Complete logs and audit trails for every step and decision.

**Flexibility:** Use any language, tool, or system - not limited to specific technologies.

**Scalability:** Steps can run in parallel when possible, and the system scales automatically.

## Common workflow patterns

**Deployment pipeline:**
- Fetch code → Build image → Run tests → Deploy to staging → Run integration tests → Deploy to production

**Incident response:**
- Detect issue → Gather diagnostics → Notify team → Apply fixes → Verify resolution → Update documentation

**Data processing:**
- Extract from source → Validate data → Transform format → Load to warehouse → Generate reports → Send notifications

**Security workflow:**
- Scan for vulnerabilities → Assess risk → Create tickets → Apply patches → Verify fixes → Report compliance

## Building workflows

**Visual editor (Composer):** Drag-and-drop interface for building workflows without coding.

**Python SDK:** Write workflows as code with full programmatic control.

**YAML definition:** Define workflows declaratively for version control and automation.

**AI generation:** Describe what you want in natural language and let AI create the workflow.

## When to use workflows

✅ **Multi-step processes** that involve several tools or systems

✅ **Repetitive tasks** you do manually that could be automated

✅ **Complex logic** with conditions, loops, or error handling

✅ **Cross-system operations** that need to coordinate multiple services

❌ **Simple single-step tasks** (use direct tool execution instead)

❌ **Highly creative tasks** that need human judgment throughout
