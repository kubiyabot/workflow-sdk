Integrations let Kubiya work with all your existing tools - from cloud platforms to communication systems to databases.

## How integrations work

**Authentication:** Kubiya securely stores your API keys, tokens, and credentials.

**Standardized interface:** All integrations expose consistent methods that AI agents understand.

**Real-time execution:** Operations happen directly through your systems' APIs in real-time.

**Error handling:** Built-in retry logic and meaningful error messages for troubleshooting.

## Categories of integrations

**Cloud platforms:**
- AWS, Azure, Google Cloud - manage infrastructure, deployments, billing
- Terraform, Pulumi - infrastructure as code automation
- CloudFormation, ARM templates - declarative infrastructure

**Container platforms:**
- Kubernetes - deploy, scale, monitor applications
- Docker - build images, manage containers
- OpenShift, Rancher - enterprise container management

**Development tools:**
- GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket - source code and CI/CD
- Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions - build automation
- Jira, Linear - issue tracking and project management

**Communication:**
- Slack, Microsoft Teams - notifications and ChatOps
- Email services - automated alerts and reports
- PagerDuty, Opsgenie - incident management

**Monitoring and observability:**
- Prometheus, Grafana - metrics and dashboards
- Datadog, New Relic - APM and infrastructure monitoring
- Splunk, Elasticsearch - log analysis

**Databases:**
- PostgreSQL, MySQL - relational databases
- MongoDB, DynamoDB - document stores
- Redis, Memcached - caching layers

## Security model

**Credential encryption:** All API keys and tokens encrypted at rest and in transit.

**Least privilege:** Integrations only get the minimum permissions needed to function.

**Network isolation:** Integration calls run in secure, isolated environments.

**Audit logging:** Every integration usage logged with full details for compliance.

**Secret rotation:** Built-in support for rotating credentials without downtime.

## Setting up integrations

**OAuth flow:** Many integrations use OAuth for secure, token-based authentication.

**API keys:** Simple API key storage for services that support it.

**Service accounts:** Dedicated service accounts for production use.

**Environment-specific:** Different credentials for development, staging, and production.

## Best practices

**Use service accounts** for production integrations, not personal accounts.

**Rotate credentials regularly** to maintain security.

**Test integrations** in non-production environments first.

**Monitor usage** to ensure integrations are healthy and performing well.

**Set appropriate permissions** - grant only what's needed.

## Troubleshooting

**Connection failures:**
- Check if credentials are still valid
- Verify network connectivity to the service
- Ensure service isn't under maintenance

**Permission errors:**
- Review granted permissions/scopes
- Check if user has adequate access in the target system
- Verify service account permissions

**Rate limiting:**
- Implement exponential backoff in workflows
- Consider caching frequently accessed data
- Monitor API usage against service limits

**Getting started:** Connect one tool you use daily to see how integrations work, then gradually add more as needed.
