# Platform Overview

Kubiya is a comprehensive platform that brings together AI intelligence and infrastructure automation. At its core, Kubiya enables AI agents to generate and execute complex workflows on your infrastructure securely and reliably.

## Core Components

### 1. Kubiya Platform

The central control plane that manages:
- **Workflow Registry**: Stores and versions workflow definitions
- **Agent Service**: Connects to AI providers for intelligent automation
- **API Gateway**: RESTful and streaming APIs for all operations
- **Security & Auth**: RBAC, audit logs, and credential management

### 2. Kubiya Runners

Kubernetes operators that execute workflows in your infrastructure:
- **Local Runners**: Deploy in your K8s clusters
- **Hosted Runners**: Managed by Kubiya for quick starts
- **Hybrid Mode**: Mix local and hosted for flexibility

### 3. Workflow Engine

The execution engine that:
- Parses workflow DAGs
- Schedules container execution
- Manages state and retries
- Streams real-time logs

### 4. AI Integration Layer

Connects various AI providers:
- **Google ADK**: Agent Development Kit integration
- **Anthropic Claude**: Via MCP protocol
- **OpenAI**: GPT models for workflow generation
- **Custom Models**: Bring your own LLMs

## Key Differentiators

### Infrastructure-First Design

Unlike SaaS workflow tools, Kubiya runs entirely in your environment:

### AI-Native Workflow Generation

Kubiya is built from the ground up for AI agents:

1. **Natural Language to DAG**: AI agents understand intent and generate structured workflows
2. **Context Awareness**: Agents have access to your tools, integrations, and patterns
3. **Learning Loop**: Workflows improve based on execution feedback
4. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Different AI models for different tasks

### Enterprise-Grade Security

Security is built into every layer:

- **Zero Trust**: Runners authenticate with mutual TLS
- **RBAC**: Fine-grained permissions for users and agents
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of all operations
- **Secrets Management**: Integration with K8s secrets, Vault, etc.
- **Network Policies**: Runners respect your K8s network policies

## Platform Capabilities

### Workflow Orchestration

- **DAG Execution**: Complex dependency graphs
- **Parallel Execution**: Run steps concurrently
- **Conditional Logic**: If/else branches
- **Loops & Iterations**: For/while constructs
- **Error Handling**: Retries, fallbacks, compensations

### Container Management

- **Any Image**: Public or private registries
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, GPU allocation
- **Volume Mounts**: Persistent and ephemeral storage
- **Environment Variables**: Secure injection
- **Network Policies**: Control container networking
