Kubiya is an AI automation platform that runs entirely on your infrastructure, giving you the benefits of AI with full control and security.

## Core components

**AI Agents** - Understand natural language requests and figure out what needs to be done.

**Workflow Engine** - Executes tasks step-by-step in isolated containers for security and reliability.

**Tool Integrations** - Connects to all your existing systems (AWS, Kubernetes, GitHub, Slack, etc.).

**Web Interface (Composer)** - Visual interface for building workflows and chatting with agents.

**Command Line Interface** - Simple CLI for running workflows and automations.

**Python SDK** - Programmatic access for developers who want to build custom solutions.

## How it works

1. **You describe what you want** in natural language
2. **AI agents understand** the request and create a plan
3. **Workflow engine executes** the plan step by step
4. **Each step runs safely** in its own container
5. **Results are returned** with full logs and audit trails

## Key benefits

**Runs on your infrastructure:**
- Complete data control and security
- No external dependencies for critical operations
- Compliance with internal security policies
- Integration with existing monitoring and logging

**Production-ready reliability:**
- Deterministic execution - same input, same output
- Container isolation prevents conflicts
- Comprehensive error handling and retries
- Full audit logs for compliance

**Easy to use:**
- Natural language interface - no complex syntax to learn
- Visual workflow builder for non-technical users
- Rich integration ecosystem
- Multiple interfaces (web, CLI, SDK) for different use cases

## Architecture principles

**Container-native:** Every operation runs in its own container for security and isolation.

**Zero-trust security:** All operations are authenticated and authorized individually.

**Stateless execution:** No persistent state between workflow runs to prevent drift.

**Event-driven:** Workflows can be triggered by schedules, webhooks, or manual execution.

## Deployment options

**Self-hosted:** Run entirely on your infrastructure with full control.

**Hybrid:** Use Kubiya's control plane with runners in your environment.

**Cloud:** Fully managed service for teams that prefer SaaS.

## Getting started

**For individuals:** Try the CLI or Composer web interface.

**For teams:** Start with Composer for collaboration and workflow sharing.

**For enterprises:** Self-hosted deployment with SSO and enterprise security features.
