Kubiya combines the intelligence of AI with the reliability of traditional automation.

## The problem with other approaches

**Pure AI agents** are unpredictable:
- Same request might do different things each time
- Hard to debug when something goes wrong  
- Can't trust them with critical infrastructure
- Might "hallucinate" or go off track

**Traditional automation** is too rigid:
- Requires extensive coding for every scenario
- Can't adapt to new situations
- Needs constant maintenance as systems change
- No natural language interface

## Kubiya's approach

**AI for understanding** - Tell it what you want in plain English and it figures out the steps.

**Deterministic execution** - Once the plan is made, it follows it exactly every time.

**Container isolation** - Each step runs safely in its own environment.

**Rich integrations** - Works with all your existing tools and systems.

## Real benefits

**For DevOps teams:**
- Deploy faster without sacrificing reliability
- Automate incident response consistently
- Scale operations without hiring more people
- Reduce human error in critical tasks

**For platform teams:**
- Enable self-service without writing custom tools
- Standardize processes across teams
- Maintain security and compliance guardrails
- Integrate disparate systems easily

**For engineering leaders:**
- Increase team productivity measurably
- Reduce operational risk through consistency
- Scale engineering operations efficiently
- Get AI benefits without AI risks

## When Kubiya makes sense

✅ **You have repetitive operational tasks** that could be automated

✅ **Your team uses multiple tools** that don't integrate well

✅ **You want AI benefits** but need production reliability

✅ **You want to scale operations** without linear headcount growth

❌ **You only have simple, single-tool workflows** (basic automation might be enough)

❌ **You need creative, open-ended AI** (try ChatGPT or Claude directly)

❌ **You have unlimited engineering resources** (custom solutions might work)

## Getting started

**Try the CLI first** - See how it works with no setup required.

**Connect one integration** - Start with a tool you use daily.

**Automate one workflow** - Pick something you do manually every week.

**Scale gradually** - Add more tools and workflows as you build confidence.

**The goal:** Make your team more effective without making your systems less reliable.
