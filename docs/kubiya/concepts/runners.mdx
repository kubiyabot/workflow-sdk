Runners execute workflows on your infrastructure - keeping your data secure while connecting to Kubiya's coordination platform.

## What runners do

**Execute workflows:** Run each workflow step in isolated containers for security and reliability.

**Stay in your infrastructure:** All data and execution happens on your servers, never leaves your environment.

**Connect to Kubiya:** Receive workflow instructions and report results back to the platform.

**Manage resources:** Handle container orchestration, secrets, networking, and storage automatically.

## Two deployment options

### Self-hosted runners (recommended for production)

Run on your own Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
helm repo add kubiya https://charts.kubiya.ai
helm install my-runner kubiya/kubiya-runner \
  --namespace kubiya \
  --create-namespace \
  --set runner.token=${RUNNER_TOKEN}
```

**Benefits:**
- Complete data control and security
- Custom resource allocation
- Integration with existing monitoring
- Compliance with internal policies

**Requirements:**
- Kubernetes cluster
- Outbound HTTPS access to Kubiya API
- Sufficient resources for workflow execution

### Hosted runners (quick start)

Managed by Kubiya for immediate use:

- Zero infrastructure setup required
- Automatic updates and scaling
- Perfect for development and testing
- No capacity planning needed

**Note:** Hosted runners are shared infrastructure - use self-hosted for production workloads.

## How runners work

1. **Connect:** Runner authenticates with Kubiya using a secure token
2. **Receive:** Gets workflow assignments from Kubiya's coordination platform  
3. **Execute:** Runs each step in isolated containers with proper resources
4. **Report:** Sends results, logs, and status back to Kubiya
5. **Clean up:** Removes containers and temporary resources after completion

## Security model

**Container isolation:** Each step runs in its own container, preventing conflicts and ensuring clean environments.

**Network policies:** Only necessary network access is allowed, with outbound HTTPS to Kubiya API.

**Secret management:** Credentials are encrypted and injected securely into workflow steps.

**RBAC:** Fine-grained permissions control what runners can do in your cluster.

**Audit logs:** Complete record of all workflow executions for compliance.

## Configuration example

```yaml
# Basic runner configuration
runner:
  name: production-runner
  token: ${RUNNER_TOKEN}
  
  # Resource limits
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "256Mi"
      cpu: "100m"
    limits:
      memory: "1Gi"
      cpu: "500m"
  
  # Workflow settings
  workflow:
    namespace: kubiya-workflows
    defaultTimeout: 30m
    maxConcurrent: 10
  
  # Security
  security:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    allowPrivileged: false
```

## Common troubleshooting

**Runner won't connect:**
- Verify token is valid
- Check outbound HTTPS connectivity
- Ensure DNS can resolve Kubiya API

**Workflows fail to start:**
- Check RBAC permissions
- Verify resource quotas
- Ensure container images are accessible

**Performance issues:**
- Increase resource limits
- Check node capacity
- Monitor image pull times

## Getting started

1. **Choose deployment:** Self-hosted for production, hosted for testing
2. **Install runner:** Use Helm chart or kubectl manifests
3. **Test connectivity:** Verify runner shows as online in Kubiya
4. **Run first workflow:** Execute a simple workflow to confirm everything works
