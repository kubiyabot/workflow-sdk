Build and run your first Kubiya workflow in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Get your API key from [app.kubiya.ai](https://app.kubiya.ai)

## 1. Install and setup

```bash
pip install kubiya-workflow-sdk
export KUBIYA_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

## 2. Create your first workflow

```python
from kubiya_workflow_sdk import workflow, run

@workflow
def hello_world():
    return "Hello from Kubiya! ðŸš€"

# Run it
result = run(hello_world)
print(result)
```

## 3. Try something useful

```python
@workflow  
def check_system():
    return "df -h"  # Check disk space

result = run(check_system)
print(result)
```

## Next steps

- **[Try Composer â†’](/composer/getting-started)** - Visual interface (easier to start with)
- **[See more examples â†’](/workflows/examples)** - Real workflow patterns
- **[Read the full docs â†’](/concepts/workflows)** - Complete SDK reference

**Prefer visual tools?** Most users find [Composer](/composer/overview) easier to start with since you can see workflows as you build them.
