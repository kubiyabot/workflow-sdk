**AI automation for your infrastructure** - chat with intelligent agents, build visual workflows, and connect all your tools in one platform.

## What can Kubiya do for you?

**Replace manual tasks with AI conversations:**
- *"Deploy my latest commit to staging"*
- *"Scale up production to handle traffic spike"*  
- *"Run security scan on all repositories"*
- *"Create pull request with bug fix"*

**Build workflows that run reliably:**
- Visual drag-and-drop designer
- Connect 100+ tools (AWS, Kubernetes, GitHub, Slack...)
- Real-time monitoring and debugging
- Team collaboration and sharing

## How it works

1. **Start with natural language** - Tell an AI agent what you need done
2. **Watch it happen** - The agent selects the right tools and executes safely  
3. **Save as workflow** - Turn successful tasks into reusable automation
4. **Share with your team** - Collaborate and scale across your organization
