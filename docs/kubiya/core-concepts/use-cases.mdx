Kubiya transforms common operational tasks from time-consuming manual processes into intelligent, automated workflows. Here are the most impactful use cases teams implement, with concrete examples and benefits.

## DevOps Automation

### **Application Deployments**

Transform deployment processes from error-prone manual steps to reliable, auditable workflows:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Traditional Process">
    **Manual deployment steps (45-90 minutes):**
    1. Developer requests deployment in Slack
    2. DevOps engineer validates readiness
    3. Manual kubectl commands or CI/CD trigger
    4. Manual monitoring of health checks
    5. Manual rollback if issues detected
    6. Status updates scattered across tools
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Kubiya Automation">
    **Automated workflow (5-15 minutes):**
    ```text
    "Deploy user-service v2.3.1 to production with gradual rollout"
    ```
    - AI validates deployment prerequisites automatically
    - Executes canary deployment with traffic shifting  
    - Monitors key metrics during rollout
    - Auto-rollback on threshold breaches
    - Updates all stakeholders via Slack/Teams
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

  alt="Deployment Workflows Dashboard"
  caption="Monitor all deployment workflows from a centralized dashboard"
/>

**Real example workflow:**
```yaml
name: microservice-deployment
trigger: slack_command("/deploy user-service v2.3.1")

steps:
  - name: validate-prerequisites
    checks: [no-blocking-incidents, green-build-status, approval-received]
    
  - name: canary-deployment
    traffic_split: [5%, 25%, 50%, 100%]
    health_checks: [http-200, avg-latency < 200ms, error-rate < 1%]
    
  - name: auto-rollback  
    condition: health_checks.failed
    rollback_to: previous_stable_version
```

### **Infrastructure Provisioning**

Automate infrastructure changes with safety and consistency:

<img
  src="/assets/images/workflow_designer_terraform.png"
  alt="Terraform Workflow Integration"
  caption="Infrastructure as Code workflows with Terraform integration"
/>

**Common scenarios:**
- *"Spin up a development environment for the mobile team"*
- *"Scale production cluster capacity for Black Friday traffic"*  
- *"Create disaster recovery environment in us-east-2"*
- *"Decommission old staging resources to reduce costs"*

```yaml
# Auto-scaling workflow example
name: traffic-surge-response
trigger: 
  type: metric_threshold
  condition: "avg(cpu_utilization) > 75% for 10 minutes"
  
steps:
  - name: analyze-traffic-patterns
    tool: datadog-analyzer
    
  - name: provision-additional-nodes
    tool: terraform-executor
    inputs:
      action: apply
      var_file: surge-scaling.tfvars
      
  - name: update-load-balancer
    tool: aws-alb
    inputs:
      targets: ${provision-additional-nodes.new_instances}
      
  - name: notify-team
    tool: slack
    message: "🚀 Auto-scaled cluster for traffic surge: +${new_node_count} nodes"
```

### **Release Management**

Coordinate complex releases across multiple services and teams:

<img
  src="/assets/images/workflow_designer_monitoring_alerts.png"
  alt="Release Monitoring Integration"
  caption="Monitor release health and automatically respond to issues"
/>

**Multi-service release workflow:**
```yaml
name: quarterly-release-q2-2024
description: "Coordinated release across 12 microservices"

phases:
  - name: pre-release-validation
    parallel_checks:
      - database-migration-tests
      - api-compatibility-validation  
      - security-vulnerability-scans
      - performance-regression-tests
      
  - name: staged-rollout
    sequence:
      - services: [auth-service, user-service] # Foundation services first
        strategy: blue-green
      - services: [payment-service, order-service] # Business logic
        strategy: canary
        depends_on: [auth-service, user-service]
      - services: [notification-service, analytics-service] # Supporting services
        strategy: rolling
        depends_on: [payment-service, order-service]
        
  - name: post-release-verification
    checks:
      - end-to-end-user-journey-tests
      - business-metrics-validation
      - error-rate-monitoring
      - performance-benchmarks
```

## Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)

### **Incident Response & Remediation**

Accelerate mean time to resolution (MTTR) with intelligent automation:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Before Kubiya" icon="clock">
    **MTTR: 45-120 minutes**
    - Manual log collection from multiple systems
    - Context switching between monitoring tools
    - Tribal knowledge required for diagnosis
    - Manual remediation steps
  </Card>
  <Card title="With Kubiya" icon="rocket">
    **MTTR: 10-25 minutes**
    - Automated evidence collection
    - AI-assisted root cause analysis  
    - Context-aware remediation suggestions
    - One-click remediation execution
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Example incident response workflow:**
```text
PagerDuty Alert: "Payment API 5xx errors spiking"
↓
Kubiya automatically:
1. Collects logs from payment service pods
2. Queries database connection metrics  
3. Checks recent deployments and changes
4. Analyzes error patterns with AI
5. Suggests remediation: "Scale payment-db connection pool"
6. Presents one-click remediation options
```

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
**Success Pattern**: Most teams start with read-only operations (monitoring, status checks) to build confidence, then gradually automate write operations (deployments, scaling) as they see the reliability and audit capabilities.
