The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows external AI assistants like Claude Desktop to connect to your Kubiya platform and execute workflows.

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open standard that lets AI assistants connect to external data sources and tools. When you connect Claude Desktop to Kubiya via MCP, Claude can:

- Browse your workflows and agents
- Execute workflows on your behalf  
- Query your connected systems
- Access your knowledge bases

## Quick Setup

1. **Install the Kubiya MCP Server**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @kubiya/mcp-server
   ```

2. **Configure Claude Desktop**
   
   Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "kubiya": {
         "command": "kubiya-mcp-server",
         "env": {
           "KUBIYA_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
           "KUBIYA_ORG": "your-org"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop**
   
   Claude will now have access to your Kubiya workflows and can execute them through natural conversation.

## Usage Example

Once connected, you can ask Claude:

> "Deploy the frontend service to staging using the deployment workflow"

Claude will:
1. Find your deployment workflow
2. Ask for any required parameters
3. Execute the workflow through Kubiya
4. Show you the results

## Security

- MCP connections use your existing Kubiya API keys
- All executions go through Kubiya's normal security controls
- You can revoke access anytime by removing the MCP server configuration

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues**: Verify your API key and organization name are correct

**Permission Errors**: Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions for the workflows you want to execute

**Workflow Not Found**: Check that the workflow name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
